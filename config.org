* Introduction
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an Emacs companion,
[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+begin_quote
Redditor 1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool. \\
Redditor 2: Oh, there's an Emacs mode for that.
#+end_quote

This was enough for me to install Emacs, but I soon learned there are [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs#why-emacs][far more
compelling reasons]] to keep using it.

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is both my config, and a cautionary tale (just replace
"Linux" with "Emacs" in the comic below).

** Why Emacs?

Emacs is [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][not a text editor]], this is a common misnomer. It is far more apt to
describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text
manipulation environment/. That's quite a mouthful.
In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related
applications. It's a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is
generic.

Good with text. How far does that go? A lot further than one initially thinks:
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Task planning]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][File management]]
+ [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Terminal emulation]]
+ [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Email client]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Remote server tool]]
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Git frontend]]
+ Web [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][client]]/[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][server]]
+ and more...

Ideally, one may use Emacs as /the/ interface to perform =input → transform →
output= cycles, i.e. form a bridge between the human mind and information
manipulation.

*** The enveloping editor
Emacs allows one to do more in one place than any other application. Why is this
good?
+ Enables one to complete tasks with a consistent, standard set of keybindings,
  GUI and editing methods --- learn once, use everywhere
+ Reduced context-switching
+ Compressing the stages of a project --- a more centralised workflow can progress
  with greater ease
+ Integration between tasks previously relegated to different applications, but
  with a common subject --- e.g. linking to an email in a to-do list

Emacs can be thought of as a platform within which various elements of your
workflow may settle, with the potential for rich integrations between them --- a
/life/ IDE if you will.

Today, many aspects of daily computer usage are split between different
applications which act like islands, but this often doesn't mirror how we
/actually use/ our computers. Emacs, if one goes down the rabbit hole, can give
users the power to bridge this gap.

*** Some notably unique features
+ Recursive editing
+ Completely introspectable, with pervasive docstrings
+ Mutable environment, which can be incrementally modified
+ Functionality without applications
+ Client-server separation allows for a daemon, giving near-instant perceived
  startup time.

*** Issues
+ Emacs has irritating quirks
+ Some aspects are showing their age (naming conventions, APIs)
+ Emacs is ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Threads.html][mostly]]) single-threaded, meaning that when something holds that
  thread up the whole application freezes
+ A few other nuisances

*** Teach a man to fish...
#+begin_quote
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed
him for a lifetime. --- Anne Isabella
#+end_quote

Most popular editors have a simple and pretty [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings][settings interface]], filled with
check-boxes, selects, and the occasional text-box. This makes it easy for the
user to pick between common desirable behaviours. To me this is now like /giving
a man a fish/.

What if you want one of those 'check-box' settings to be only on in certain
conditions? Some editors have workspace settings, but that requires you to
manually set the value for /every single instance/. Urgh, [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93153][what]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93628][a]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5595][pain]].

What if you could set the value of that 'check-box' setting to be the result of
an arbitrary expression evaluated for each file? This is where an editor like
Emacs comes in.
Configuration for Emacs isn't a list of settings in JSON etc. it's *an executable
program which modifies the behaviour of the editor to suit your liking*.
This is 'teaching a man to fish'.

Emacs is built in the same language you configure it in (Emacs [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][elisp]]).
It comes with a broad array of useful functions for text-editing, and Doom adds
a few handy little convenience functions.

Want to add a keybinding to delete the previous line? It's as easy as
#+name: Keybinding to delete the previous line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(map! "C-d"
      (cmd! (previous-line)
            (kill-line)
            (forward-line)))
#+end_src

How about another example, say you want to be presented with a list of currently
open /buffers/ (think files, almost) when you split the window. It's as simple as
#+name: Prompt for buffer after split
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after 'window-split (switch-to-buffer))
#+end_src

Want to test it out? You don't need to save and restart, you can just /evaluate
the expression/ within your current Emacs instance and try it immediately! This
editor is, after all, a Lisp interpreter.

Want to tweak the behaviour? Just re-evaluate your new version --- it's a
super-tight iteration loop.

** Editor comparison

Over the years I have tried out (spent at least a year using as my primary
editor) the following applications
- Python IDLE
- Komodo Edit
- Brackets
- VSCode
- and now, Emacs

I have attempted to quantify aspects of my impressions of them below.

#+plot: transpose:yes type:radar min:0 max:4 ticks:4 file:"misc/editor-comparison.svg"

** Rudimentary configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports none :comments no :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#+end_src
** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "xhyang"
      user-mail-address "linux.xhyang@gmail.com")
#+end_src
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authinfo.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidentally purge this file (I have done
src_shell{rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before}. I also want to cache as much as possible, as
my home machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src
performance debug
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+end_src
** Better defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))   ; On laptops...
  (display-battery-mode 1))                       ; it's nice to know how much power you have

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src
*** Frame sizing
It's nice to control the size of new frames, when launching Emacs that can be
done with src_shell{emacs -geometry 160x48}. After the font size adjustment
during initialisation this works out to be ~102x31~.

Thanks to hotkeys, it's easy for me to expand a frame to half/full-screen, so it
makes sense to be conservative with the sizing of new frames.

Then, for creating new frames within the same Emacs instance, we'll just set the
default to be something roughly 80% of that size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+end_src
*** Auto-customisations
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src
*** Windows
I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up a buffer prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      ;; Navigation
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
      "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
      "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
      "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
      ;; Swapping windows
      "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
      "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
      "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
      "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
#+end_src
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
*** All the icons
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! all-the-icons
  (when (and (display-graphic-p)
               (not (find-font (font-spec :name "all-the-icons"))))
    (all-the-icons-install-fonts t))
  )
#+end_src
** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments no

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).
#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

**** Interface
There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match. Just for fun I'm
trying out JetBrains Mono though. So far I have mixed feelings on it, some
aspects are nice, but on others I prefer Fira.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 18)
        doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 26)
        ;;doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 24)
        ;;doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
        ;;doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'light)
        )
#+end_src

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.

#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar required-fonts '("JetBrains Mono" "Merriweather" "Alegreya" "all\\\\-the\\\\-icons"))

(defvar available-fonts
  (delete-dups (or (font-family-list)
                   (split-string (shell-command-to-string "fc-list : family")
                                 "[,\n]"))))

(defvar missing-fonts
  (delq nil (mapcar
             (lambda (font)
               (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                           (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))
                                         available-fonts))
                 font))
             required-fonts)))

(if missing-fonts
    (pp-to-string
     `(unless noninteractive
        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook
          (run-at-time nil nil
                       (lambda ()
                         (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                  (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                  (mapconcat (lambda (font)
                                               (propertize font 'face 'font-lock-variable-name-face))
                                             ',missing-fonts
                                             ", "))
                         (sleep-for 0.5))))))
  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<detect-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

**** Theme and modeline

~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+end_src
*** Asynchronous config tangling
Doom adds an =org-mode= hook ~+literate-enable-recompile-h~. This is a nice idea,
but it's too blocking for my taste. Since I trust my tangling to be fairly
straightforward, I'll just redefine it to a simpler, async, function.

*** Dashboard quick actions

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src
*** Window title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.
* Packages
** Loading instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~ macro in
=packages.el=, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line.
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

You'll then need to restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least,
run =M-x doom/reload=.

*Warning*: Don't disable core packages listed in =~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el=.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages from git repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src
** Convenience
*** Avy
#+begin_quote
From the =:config default= module.
#+end_quote


What a wonderful way to jump to buffer positions, and it uses the QWERTY
home-row for jumping. Very convenient ... except I'm using Colemak.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (= 0 (call-process "sh" nil nil nil "-c" "dmesg | grep -q 'ErgoDox'")) "yes" "no")
(after! avy
  ;; home row priorities: 8 6 4 5 - - 1 2 3 7
  (setq avy-keys '(?n ?e ?i ?s ?t ?r ?i ?a)))
#+end_src

*** Rotate (window management)
The =rotate= package just adds the ability to rotate window layouts, but that
sounds nice to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! rotate :pin "4e9ac3ff800880bd9b705794ef0f7c99d72900a6")
#+end_src

*** Emacs Everywhere
The name says it all. It's loaded and set up (a bit) by =:app everywhere=, however
as I develop this I want the unpinned version I have as a submodule.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! emacs-everywhere :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/emacs-everywhere"))
(unpin! emacs-everywhere)
#+end_src

Additionally, I'm going to make some personal choices that aren't made in the
Doom module.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! emacs-everywhere
  :if (daemonp)
  :config
  (require 'spell-fu)
  (setq emacs-everywhere-major-mode-function #'org-mode
        emacs-everywhere-frame-name-format "Edit ∷ %s — %s")
  (defadvice! emacs-everywhere-raise-frame ()
    :after #'emacs-everywhere-set-frame-name
    (setq emacs-everywhere-frame-name (format emacs-everywhere-frame-name-format
                                (emacs-everywhere-app-class emacs-everywhere-current-app)
                                (truncate-string-to-width
                                 (emacs-everywhere-app-title emacs-everywhere-current-app)
                                 45 nil nil "…")))
    ;; need to wait till frame refresh happen before really set
    (run-with-timer 0.1 nil #'emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1))
  (defun emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1 ()
    (call-process "wmctrl" nil nil nil "-a" emacs-everywhere-frame-name)))
#+end_src
*** Which-key
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Let's make this popup a bit faster
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
#+end_src

This package enables the very nice inline evaluation with =gr= and =gR=. The prefix

#+end_src

*** EVIL
#+begin_quote
From the =:editor evil= module.
#+end_quote

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.

Now, EVIL cares a fair bit about keeping compatibility with Vim's default
behaviour. I don't. There are some particular settings that I'd rather be
something else, so let's change them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

I don't use ~evil-escape-mode~, so I may as well turn it off, I've heard it
contributes a typing delay. I'm not sure it's much, but it is an extra
~pre-command-hook~ that I don't benefit from, so...
It seems that there's a dedicated package for this, so instead of just disabling
the mode on startup, let's prevent installation of the package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! evil-escape :disable t)
#+end_src

*** Consult
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Since we're using [[Marginalia]] too, the separation between buffers and files is
already clear, and there's no need for a different face.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! consult
  (set-face-attribute 'consult-file nil :inherit 'consult-buffer)
  (setf (plist-get (alist-get 'perl consult-async-split-styles-alist) :initial) ";"))
#+end_src

*** Magit
#+begin_quote
From the =:tools magit= module.

One little thing I want to add is some per-project commit message templates.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +magit-project-commit-templates-alist nil
  "Alist of toplevel dirs and template strings/functions.")
(after! magit
  (defun +magit-fill-in-commit-template ()
    "Insert template from `+magit-fill-in-commit-template' if applicable."
    (when-let ((template (and (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (string-match-p "\\`\\s-*$" (thing-at-point 'line)))
                              (cdr (assoc (file-name-base (directory-file-name (magit-toplevel)))
                                          +magit-project-commit-templates-alist)))))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert (if (stringp template) template (funcall template)))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (end-of-line)))
  (add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook #'+magit-fill-in-commit-template 90))
#+end_src

This is particularly useful when creating commits for Org, as they need to
follow [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html#commit-messages][a certain format]] and sometimes I forget elements (oops!).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! magit
  (defun +org-commit-message-template ()
    "Create a skeleton for an Org commit message based on the staged diff."
    (let (change-data last-file file-changes temp-point)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (apply #'call-process magit-git-executable
               nil t nil
               (append
                magit-git-global-arguments
                (list "diff" "--cached")))
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "^@@\\|^\\+\\+\\+ b/" nil t)
          (if (looking-back "^\\+\\+\\+ b/" (line-beginning-position))
              (progn
                (push (list last-file file-changes) change-data)
                (setq last-file (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (line-end-position))
                      file-changes nil))
            (setq temp-point (line-beginning-position))
            (re-search-forward "^\\+\\|^-" nil t)
            (end-of-line)
            (cond
             ((string-match-p "\\.el$" last-file)
              (when (re-search-backward "^\\(?:[+-]? *\\|@@[ +-\\d,]+@@ \\)(\\(?:cl-\\)?\\(?:defun\\|defvar\\|defmacro\\|defcustom\\)" temp-point t)
                (re-search-forward "\\(?:cl-\\)?\\(?:defun\\|defvar\\|defmacro\\|defcustom\\) " nil t)
                (add-to-list 'file-changes (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (forward-symbol 1)))))
             ((string-match-p "\\.org$" last-file)
              (when (re-search-backward "^[+-]\\*+ \\|^@@[ +-\\d,]+@@ \\*+ " temp-point t)
                (re-search-forward "@@ \\*+ " nil t)
                (add-to-list 'file-changes (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (line-end-position)))))))))
      (push (list last-file file-changes) change-data)
      (setq change-data (delete '(nil nil) change-data))
      (concat
       (if (= 1 (length change-data))
           (replace-regexp-in-string "^.*/\\|.[a-z]+$" "" (caar change-data))
         "?")
       ": \n\n"
       (mapconcat
        (lambda (file-changes)
          (if (cadr file-changes)
              (format "* %s (%s): "
                      (car file-changes)
                      (mapconcat #'identity (cadr file-changes) ", "))
            (format "* %s: " (car file-changes))))
        change-data
        "\n\n"))))

  (add-to-list '+magit-project-commit-templates-alist (cons "org-mode" #'+org-commit-message-template)))
#+end_src

This relies on two small entries in the git config files which improves the hunk
heading line selection for elisp and Org files.
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(((;;;+ )|\\(|([ \t]+\\(((cl-|el-patch-)?def(un|var|macro|method|custom)|gb/))).*)$"

[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

*** Magit delta

[[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] is a git diff syntax highlighter written in rust. The author also wrote a
package to hook this into the magit diff view (which don't get any syntax
highlighting by default). This requires the ~delta~ binary. It's packaged on some
distributions, but most reliably installed through Rust's package manager cargo.

#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (or (not (executable-find "cargo")) (executable-find "delta")) "no" "setup.sh")
cargo install git-delta
#+end_src

Now we can make use of the package for this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;; (package! magit-delta :recipe (:host github :repo "dandavison/magit-delta") :pin "5fc7dbddcfacfe46d3fd876172ad02a9ab6ac616")
#+end_src

All that's left is to hook it into magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (after! magit
;;   (magit-delta-mode +1))
#+end_src
Unfortunately this currently seems to mess things up, which is something I'll
want to look into later.

*** Smerge

For repeated operations, a hydra would be helpful. But I prefer transient.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun smerge-repeatedly ()
  "Perform smerge actions again and again"
  (interactive)
  (smerge-mode 1)
  (smerge-transient))
(after! transient
  (transient-define-prefix smerge-transient ()
    [["Move"
      ("n" "next" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-next)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("p" "previous" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-prev)) (smerge-repeatedly)))]
     ["Keep"
      ("b" "base" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-base)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("u" "upper" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-upper)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("l" "lower" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-lower)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("a" "all" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-all)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("RET" "current" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-current)) (smerge-repeatedly)))]
     ["Diff"
      ("<" "upper/base" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-diff-base-upper)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("=" "upper/lower" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-diff-upper-lower)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      (">" "base/lower" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-diff-base-lower)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("R" "refine" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-refine)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("E" "ediff" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-ediff)) (smerge-repeatedly)))]
     ["Other"
      ("c" "combine" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-combine-with-next)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("r" "resolve" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-resolve)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("k" "kill current" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-kill-current)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("q" "quit" (lambda () (interactive) (smerge-auto-leave)))]]))
#+end_src

*** Company
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion company= module.
#+end_quote

It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.5
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
  (setq company-box-doc-enable nil)
  (add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
#+end_src
Now, the improvements from ~precedent~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.

*** Projectile
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.

Looking at documentation via =SPC h f= and =SPC h v= and looking at the source can
add package src directories to projectile. This isn't desirable in my opinion.

Some light configuring is all we need, so we can make use of the [[https://github.com/Calinou/0x0][0x0]] wrapper
file uploading script (which I've renamed to ~upload~).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Etrace

The /Emacs Lisp Profiler/ (ELP) does a nice job recording information, but it
isn't the best for looking at results. =etrace= converts ELP's results to the
"Chromium Catapult Trace Event Format". This means that the output of =etrace= can
be loaded in something like the [[https://www.speedscope.app/][speedscope]] webapp for easier profile
investigation.

*** Modus themes
Proteolas did a lovely job with the Modus themes, so much so that they were
welcomed into Emacs 28. However, he is also rather attentive with updates, and
so I'd like to make sure we have a recent version.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

*** Theme magic

With all our fancy Emacs themes, my terminal is missing out!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! theme-magic :pin "844c4311bd26ebafd4b6a1d72ddcc65d87f074e3")
#+end_src

This operates using =pywal=, which is present in some repositories, but most
reliably installed with =pip=.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pywal
#+end_src

Theme magic takes a look at a number of faces, the saturation levels, and colour
differences to try to cleverly pick eight colours to use. However, it uses the
same colours for the light variants, and doesn't always make the best picks.
Since we're using =doom-themes=, our life is a little easier and we can use the
colour utilities from Doom themes to easily grab sensible colours and generate
lightened versions --- let's do that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! theme-magic
  :commands theme-magic-from-emacs

*** Emojify
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui emoji= module.
#+end_quote


For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB 😀.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2-22")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Now, it would be good to have a minor mode which allowed you to type ascii/gh
emojis and get them converted to unicode. Let's make one.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify--replace-text-with-emoji (orig-fn emoji text buffer start end &optional target)
  "Modify `emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji' to replace ascii/github emoticons with unicode emojis, on the fly."
  (if (or (not emoticon-to-emoji) (= 1 (length text)))
      (funcall orig-fn emoji text buffer start end target)
    (delete-region start end)
    (insert (ht-get emoji "unicode"))))

(define-minor-mode emoticon-to-emoji
  "Write ascii/gh emojis, and have them converted to unicode live."
  :global nil
  :init-value nil
  (if emoticon-to-emoji
      (progn
        (setq-local emojify-emoji-styles '(ascii github unicode))
        (advice-add 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji :around #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)
        (unless emojify-mode

    (advice-remove 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)))
#+end_src

This new minor mode of ours will be nice for messages, so let's hook it in for
Email and IRC.

*** Doom modeline
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui modeline= module.
#+end_quote


Very nice and pretty, however I think the PDF modeline could do with tweaking.
I raised [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/pull/425][an issue]] on this, however the response was basically "put your
preferences in your personal config, the current default is sensible" --- so
here we are.

First up I'm going to want a segment for just the buffer file name, and a PDF
icon. Then we'll redefine two functions used to generate the modeline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (doom-modeline-def-segment pdf-icon

    (concat

                         :v-adjust 0.02)))

  (defun doom-modeline-update-pdf-pages ()
    "Update PDF pages."
    (setq doom-modeline--pdf-pages
          (let ((current-page-str (number-to-string (eval `(pdf-view-current-page))))
                (total-page-str (number-to-string (pdf-cache-number-of-pages))))
            (concat

*** Keycast

For some reason, I find myself demoing Emacs every now and then. Showing what
keyboard stuff I'm doing on-screen seems helpful. While [[https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey][screenkey]] does exist,
having something that doesn't cover up screen content is nice.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of Keycast-mode in action

Let's just make sure this is lazy-loaded appropriately.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Screencast

In a similar manner to [[Keycast]], [[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast][gif-screencast]] may come in handy.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! gif-screencast :pin "5517a557a17d8016c9e26b0acb74197550f829b9")
#+end_src

We can lazy load this using the start/stop commands.

I initially installed ~scrot~ for this, since it was the default capture program.
However it raised ~glib error: Saving to file ... failed~ each time it was run.
Google didn't reveal any easy fixed, so I switched to [[https://github.com/naelstrof/maim][maim]]. We now need to pass
it the window ID. This doesn't change throughout the lifetime of an emacs
instance, so as long as a single window is used ~xdotool getactivewindow~ will
give a satisfactory result.

It seems that when new colours appear, that tends to make ~gifsicle~ introduce
artefacts. To avoid this we pre-populate the colour map using the current doom
theme.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! gif-screencast

*** Mixed pitch
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote


We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default. This was created
for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 27))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't to hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))

*** Marginalia
#+begin_quote
Part of the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Marginalia is nice, but the file metadata annotations are a little too plain.
Specifically, I have these gripes
+ File attributes would be nicer if coloured
+ I don't care about the user/group information if the user/group is me
+ When a file time is recent, a relative age (e.g. =2h ago=) is more useful than
  the date
+ An indication of file fatness would be nice

Thanks to the ~marginalia-annotator-registry~, we don't have to advise, we can
just add a new =file= annotator.

Another small thing is the face used for docstrings. At the moment it's =(italic
shadow)=, but I don't like that.

=all-the-icons= does a generally great job giving file names icons. One minor
niggle I have is that when /I/ open a =.m= file, it's much more likely to be Matlab
than Objective-C. As such, it'll be switching the icon associated with =.m=.

** Calculator

ability to create LaTeX representations of its expressions provides a lovely
opportunity which is taken advantage of in the CalcTeX package.

We'd like to use CalcTeX too, so let's set that up, and fix some glaring
inadequacies --- why on earth would you commit a hard-coded path to an executable
that /only works on your local machine/, consequently breaking the package for
everyone else!?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Embedded calc

Embedded calc is a lovely feature which let's us use calc to operate on LaTeX
maths expressions. The standard keybinding is a bit janky however (=C-x * e=), so
we'll add a localleader-based alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map calc-mode-map
      :after calc
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "E" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map latex-mode-map
      :after latex
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
#+end_src

Unfortunately this operates without the (rather informative) calculator and
trail buffers, but we can advice it that we would rather like those in a side
panel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar calc-embedded-trail-window nil)
(defvar calc-embedded-calculator-window nil)

(defadvice! calc-embedded-with-side-pannel (&rest _)
  :after #'calc-do-embedded
  (when calc-embedded-trail-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-trail-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-trail-window nil))
  (when calc-embedded-calculator-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-calculator-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window nil))
  (when (and calc-embedded-info
             (> (* (window-width) (window-height)) 1200))
    (let ((main-window (selected-window))
          (vertical-p (> (window-width) 80)))
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-trail-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-horizontally (- (max 30 (/ (window-width) 3))))
               (split-window-vertically (- (max 8 (/ (window-height) 4)))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calc Trail*")
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-vertically -6)
               (split-window-horizontally (- (/ (window-width) 2))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calculator*")
      (select-window main-window))))

** Dictionary
Doom already loads =define-word=, and provides it's own definition service using
[[https://github.com/gromnitsky/wordnut][wordnut]]. However, using an offline dictionary possess a few compelling
advantages, namely:
+ speed
+ integration of multiple dictionaries
[[http://goldendict.org/][GoldenDict]] seems like the best option currently available, but lacks a CLI.
Hence, we'll fall back to [[https://dushistov.github.io/sdcv/][sdcv]] (a CLI version of StarDict) for now.
To interface with this, we'll use a my =lexic= package.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the lexic-mode view of "literate"
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/lexic.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "packages.el" "no")
(package! lexic :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/lexic"))
#+end_src

Given that a request for a CLI is the [[https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/issues/37][most upvoted issue]] on GitHub for
GoldenDict, it's likely we'll be able to switch from ~sdcv~ to that in the future.

Since GoldenDict supports StarDict files, I expect this will be a relatively
painless switch.

We start off by loading =lexic=, then we'll integrate it into pre-existing
definition functionality (like ~+lookup/dictionary-definition~).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "yes" "no")
(use-package! lexic
  :commands lexic-search lexic-list-dictionary
  :config
  (map! :map lexic-mode-map
        :n "q" #'lexic-return-from-lexic
        :nv "RET" #'lexic-search-word-at-point
        :n "a" #'outline-show-all
        :n "h" (cmd! (outline-hide-sublevels 3))
        :n "o" #'lexic-toggle-entry
        :n "n" #'lexic-next-entry
        :n "N" (cmd! (lexic-next-entry t))
        :n "p" #'lexic-previous-entry
        :n "P" (cmd! (lexic-previous-entry t))
        :n "E" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; expand
                     (switch-to-buffer (lexic-get-buffer)))
        :n "M" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; minimise
                     (lexic-goto-lexic))
        :n "C-p" #'lexic-search-history-backwards
        :n "C-n" #'lexic-search-history-forwards
        :n "/" (cmd! (call-interactively #'lexic-search))))
#+end_src

Now let's use this instead of wordnet.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "yes" "no")

Lastly, I want to make sure I have some dictionaries set up. I've put a tarball

** General
*** File Templates

Beyond the elegance in the markup language, tremendously rich integrations with
Emacs allow for some fantastic [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][features]], such as what seems to be the best
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] of any currently available technology.

An =.org= file can contain blocks of code (with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb][noweb]] templating support), which
can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] to dedicated source code files, and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][woven]] into a document
(report, documentation, presentation, etc.) through various (/extensible/) methods.
These source blocks may even create images or other content to be included in
the document, or generate source code.

Finally, because this section is fairly expensive to initialise, we'll wrap it

*** System config
**** Mime types
Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">

    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
#+end_src
What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org
#+end_src
**** Git diffs
Protesilaos wrote a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-26-git-diff-hunk-elisp-org/][very helpful article]] in which he explains how to change the
git diff chunk heading to something more useful than just the immediate line
above the hunk --- like the parent heading.

This can be achieved by first adding a new diff mode to git in =~/.config/git/attributes=
#+begin_src fundamental
,*.org   diff=org
#+end_src

Then adding a regex for it to =~/.config/git/config=
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

**** Visuals
***** Tables

Org tables aren't the prettiest thing to look at. This package is supposed to
redraw them in the buffer with box-drawing characters. Sounds like an
improvement to me! We'll make use of this with =writeroom-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-pretty-table

  :commands (org-pretty-table-mode global-org-pretty-table-mode))
#+end_src

***** Emphasis markers
While ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ is very nice, it can sometimes make edits which
occur at the border a bit more fiddley. We can improve this situation without
sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-appear :recipe (:host github :repo "awth13/org-appear")
  :pin "303fcc8d5d85a4ebff2798dab50b2ccc0255ea5f")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)

***** Cooking recipes
I *need* this in my life. It take a URL to a recipe from a common site, and
inserts an org-ified version at point. Isn't that just great.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** Importing with Pandoc

Sometimes I'm given non-org files, that's very sad. Luckily Pandoc offers a way
to make that right again, and this package makes that even easier to do.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

***** Document comparison
It's quite nice to compare Org files, and the richest way to compare content is
probably =latexdiff=. There are a few annoying steps involved here, and so I've
written a package to streamline the process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! orgdiff :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/orgdiff"))
#+end_src

The only little annoyance is the fact that =latexdiff= uses ~#FF0000~ and ~#0000FF~ as
the red/blue change indication colours. We can make this a bit nicer by
post-processing the =latexdiff= result.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! orgdiff
  :defer t
  :config
  (defun +orgdiff-nicer-change-colours ()
    (goto-char (point-min))
    ;; Set red/blue based on whether chameleon is being used
    (if (search-forward "%% make document follow Emacs theme" nil t)
        (setq red  (substring (doom-blend 'red 'fg 0.8) 1)
              blue (substring (doom-blend 'blue 'teal 0.6) 1))
      (setq red  "c82829"
            blue "00618a"))
    (when (and (search-forward "%DIF PREAMBLE EXTENSION ADDED BY LATEXDIFF" nil t)
               (search-forward "\\RequirePackage{color}" nil t))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{red}{rgb}{1,0,0}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{red}{HTML}{%s}" red)))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{blue}{rgb}{0,0,1}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{blue}{HTML}{%s}" blue)))))
  (add-to-list 'orgdiff-latexdiff-postprocess-hooks #'+orgdiff-nicer-change-colours))
#+end_src

*** Behaviour
**** Tweaking defaults
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory (cl-find-if #'file-exists-p '("~/note/org/gtd" "~/Nextcloud/note/org/gtd" "~/.org"))                      ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convenient
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})       ; don't treat lone _ / ^ as sub/superscripts, require _{} / ^{}
#+end_src
I also like the src_elisp{:comments} header-argument, so let's make that a
default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

There also seem to be a few keybindings which use =hjkl=, but miss arrow key equivalents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-org-mode-map
      :after evil-org
      :n "g <up>" #'org-backward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <down>" #'org-forward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <left>" #'org-up-element
      :n "g <right>" #'org-down-element)
#+end_src
**** Extra functionality
***** Org buffer creation
Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb-ref none
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src
***** The utility of zero-width spaces
Occasionally in Org you run into annoyances where you want to have two seperate
blocks right together without a space. For example, to *emp​h*​asise part of a word,
or put a currency symbol immediately before an inline source block.
There is a solution to this, it just sounds slightly hacky --- zero width spaces.
Because this is Emacs, we can make this feel much less hacky by making a minor
addition to the Org key map 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :nie "M-SPC M-SPC" (cmd! (insert "\u200B")))
#+end_src

We then want to stop the space from being included in exports, which can be done
with a little filter.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-remove-zero-width-space (text _backend _info)
  "Remove zero width spaces from TEXT."
  (unless (org-export-derived-backend-p 'org)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "\u200B" "" text)))

(after! ox
  (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-export-remove-zero-width-space t))
#+end_src
***** List bullet sequence
I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src
***** Citation
Occasionally I want to cite something, and =org-ref= is /the/ package for that.

Unfortunately, it ignores the ~file = {...}~ =.bib= keys though. Let's fix that.
I separate files on =;=, which may just be a Zotero/BetterBibLaTeX thing, but it's
a good idea in my case at least.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(use-package! org-ref
  ;; :after org
  :defer t
  :config
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf-a ()
    :override #'org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf
    (save-excursion
      (bibtex-beginning-of-entry)
      (let* ((bibtex-expand-strings t)
             (entry (bibtex-parse-entry t))
             (key (reftex-get-bib-field "=key=" entry))
             (pdf (or
                   (car (-filter (lambda (f) (string-match-p "\\.pdf$" f))
                                 (split-string (reftex-get-bib-field "file" entry) ";")))
                   (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key))))
        (if (file-exists-p pdf)
            (org-open-file pdf)
          (ding)))))
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-pdf-at-point-a ()
    "Open the pdf for bibtex key under point if it exists."
    :override #'org-ref-open-pdf-at-point
    (interactive)
    (let* ((results (org-ref-get-bibtex-key-and-file))
           (key (car results))
           (pdf-file (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key)))
      (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect (cdr results))
        (save-excursion
          (bibtex-search-entry (car results))
          (org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf))))))
#+end_src

There's also the new =org-cite= though. It would be nice to try that out.

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)

I'll just set this to be within =Organisation= folder for now, in the future it

**** Nicer generated heading IDs
Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's completely uninformative, I have no idea what's being referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

**** Snippet Helpers

I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers
                                  (intern (concat "org-babel-default-header-args:"
                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))
                  values))
    (let ((selection (consult--read values :prompt question :default default-value)))
      (unless (or (string-match-p "(default)$" selection)
                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-lang ()
  "Try to find the current language of the src/header at `point'.

      ('src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('inline-src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('keyword (when (string-match "^header-args:\\([^ ]+\\)" (org-element-property :value context))
                  (match-string 1 (org-element-property :value context)))))))

  "Return the language of the last src-block, if it exists."
  (save-excursion

(defun +yas/org-most-common-no-property-lang ()
  "Find the lang with the most source blocks that has no global header-args, else nil."
  (let (src-langs header-langs)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) src-langs))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) header-langs)))

    (setq src-langs
          (mapcar #'car
                  ;; sort alist by frequency (desc.)
                  (sort
                   ;; generate alist with form (value . frequency)
                   (cl-loop for (n . m) in (seq-group-by #'identity src-langs)
                            collect (cons n (length m)))
                   (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b))))))

    (car (cl-set-difference src-langs header-langs :test #'string=))))

**** Translate capital keywords (old) to lower case (new)

is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.
#+begin_quote
Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]
#+end_quote

To avoid sometimes having to choose between the hassle out of updating old
documents and using mixed syntax, I'll whip up a basic transcode-y function.
It likely misses some edge cases, but should mostly work.

          (case-fold-search nil))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+[A-Z_]+" nil t)
        (unless (s-matches-p "RESULTS" (match-string 0))
          (replace-match (downcase (match-string 0)) t)
          (setq count (1+ count))))
      (message "Replaced %d occurances" count))))

**** Fix problematic hooks

**** Flycheck with org-lint

Org may be simple, but that doesn't mean there's no such thing as malformed Org.
Thankfully, malformed Org is a much less annoying affair than malformed zipped
XML (looks at DOCX/ODT...), particularly because there's a rather helpful little
tool called ~org-lint~ bundled with Org that can tell you about your mistakes.

Flycheck doesn't currently support Org, and there's aren't any packages to do so
☹. However, in an issue on ~org-lint~ there is [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1757#issuecomment-759546940][some code]] which apparently works.
Surely this is what the clipboard was invented for? With that said, let's
regurgitate the code, cross our fingers, and hope it works.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst flycheck-org-lint-form
  (flycheck-prepare-emacs-lisp-form
    (require 'org)
    (require 'org-attach)
    (let ((source (car command-line-args-left))

            (princ (elt inf 0))
            (princ ": ")
            (princ (elt inf 2))
            (terpri)))))))

(defconst flycheck-org-lint-variables

    org-link-parameters)
  "Variables inherited by the org-lint subprocess.")

(defun flycheck-org-lint-variables-form ()
  (require 'org-attach)  ; Needed to make variables available
  `(progn
     ,@(seq-map (lambda (opt) `(setq-default ,opt ',(symbol-value opt)))
                (seq-filter #'boundp flycheck-org-lint-variables))))

(flycheck-define-checker org-lint
  "Org buffer checker using `org-lint'."
  :command ("emacs" (eval flycheck-emacs-args)
            "--eval" (eval (concat "(add-to-list 'load-path \""
                                   (file-name-directory (locate-library "org"))
                                   "\")"))
            "--eval" (eval (flycheck-sexp-to-string
                            (flycheck-org-lint-variables-form)))

            "--" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start line ": " (message) line-end))
  :modes org-mode)
#+end_src

Turns out it almost works. Running =M-x flycheck-verify-setup= after running that
snippet produces the following:
#+begin_example
The following syntax checkers are not registered:
  - org-lint
Try adding these syntax checkers to `flycheck-checkers'.
#+end_example

Well that's very nice and helpful. We'll just do that 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'org-lint)
#+end_src

It was missing custom link types, but that's easily fixed just by adding
~org-link-parameters~ to ~flycheck-org-lint-variables~.

One remaining little annoyance is that it reports extra =#+options= that I've
added to Org as errors. So we need to tell ~org-lint~ about them without having it
load my whole config. Code duplication isn't great, but at least this isn't
much.

#+name: org-syntax-modifications

                 (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex)))))
#+end_src

*** Visuals

Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

**** Font Display
Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src
Apparently this causes issues with some people, but I haven't noticed anything
problematic beyond the expected slight delay in some fontification, so until I
do I'll use the above.

**** Fontifying inline src blocks
Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.

**** Symbols

It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.
I've also added some fun alternatives, just commented out.

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier highlighting
First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** More eager rendering
What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! org-fragtog :pin "680606189d5d28039e6f9301b55ec80517a24005")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering
It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).
Let's start by adding a sans font. I'd also like to use some of the
functionality from =bmc-maths=, so we'll load that too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-2.54cm}
\\setlength{\\evensidemargin}{\\oddsidemargin}
\\setlength{\\textheight}{\\paperheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headsep}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\footskip}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\topmargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-2.54cm}
% my custom stuff
\\usepackage[nofont,plaindd]{bmc-maths}
\\usepackage{arev}
")
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-options
      (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent"))
#+end_src

***** Rendering speed tests
We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|--------------+-----------------|
| 135 \pm 2 ms | 215 \pm 3 ms    |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|---------------+----------------+----------------|
| 89 \pm 2 ms   | 178 \pm 2 ms   | 12 \pm 2 ms    |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain             | Total time   | Resultant file size |
|------------------------+--------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226 \pm 2 ms | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392 \pm 4 ms | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230 \pm 2 ms | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[LaTeX Rendering]].

Unfortunately, it seems that SVG sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now.

*** Exporting
**** General settings
By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(latex-header-blocks ignore-headlines))
#+end_src

Since I (roughly) track Org ~HEAD~, it makes sense to include the git version in
the creator string.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-creator-string
      (format "Emacs %s (Org mode %s–%s)" emacs-version (org-release) (org-git-version)))
#+end_src

**** Acronym formatting
I like automatically using spaced small caps for acronyms. For strings I want to
be unaffected let's use ~;~ as a prefix to prevent the transformation --- i.e.
~;JFK~ (as one would want for two-letter geographic locations and names).

This has to be implemented on a per-format basis, currently HTML and LaTeX
exports are supported.

**** Collapsable src and example blocks
By wrapping the ~<pre>~ element in a ~<details>~ block, we can obtain collapsable
blocks with no CSS, though we will toss a little in anyway to have this looking
somewhat spiffy.

Since this collapsability seems useful to have on by default for certain chunks
of code, it would be nice if you could set it with =#+attr_html: :collapsed t=.

It would be nice to also have a corresponding global / session-local way of
setting this, but I haven't quite been able to get that working (yet).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-html-export-collapsed nil)
(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:collapsed "COLLAPSED" "collapsed" org-html-export-collapsed t)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'html))))
(add-to-list 'org-default-properties "EXPORT_COLLAPSED")
#+end_src

We can take our src block modification a step further, and add a gutter on the
side of the src block containing both an anchor referencing the current block,
and a button to copy the content of the block.

**** Include extra font-locking in htmlize

Org uses [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize.el]] to export buffers with syntax highlighting.

The works fantastically, for the most part. Minor modes that provide
font-locking are /not/ loaded, and so do not impact the result.

By enabling these modes in ~htmlize-before-hook~ we can correct this behaviour.

**** Handle table overflow
In order to accommodate wide tables ---particularly on mobile devices--- we want
to set a maximum width and scroll overflow. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied
directly to the ~table~ element, so we have to wrap it in a ~div~.

While we're at it, we can a link gutter, as we did with src blocks, and show the
~#+name~, if one is given.

**** TOC as a collapsable tree
The TOC is much nicer to navigate as a collapsable tree. Unfortunately we cannot
achieve this with CSS alone. Thankfully we can avoid JS though, by adapting the
TOC generation code to use a ~label~ for each item, and a hidden ~checkbox~ to keep
track of state.

To add this, we need to change one line in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-mode/lisp/ox-html.el::(format "<a href=\"#%s\">%s</a>"][org-html--format-toc-headline]].

Since we can actually accomplish the desired effect by adding advice /around/ the
function, without overriding it --- let's do that to reduce the bug surface of
this config a tad.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable (orig-fn headline info)
  "Add a label and checkbox to `org-html--format-toc-headline's usual output,
to allow the TOC to be a collapseable tree."
  :around #'org-html--format-toc-headline
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn headline info)
    (let ((id (or (org-element-property :CUSTOM_ID headline)
                  (org-export-get-reference headline info))))
      (format "<input type='checkbox' id='toc--%s'/><label for='toc--%s'>%s</label>"
              id id (funcall orig-fn headline info)))))
#+end_src

Now, leaves (headings with no children) shouldn't have the ~label~ item. The
obvious way to achieve this is by including some /if no children.../ logic in
~org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable~. Unfortunately, I can't my elisp isn't
up to par to extract the number of child headings from the mountain of info that
org provides.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--toc-text-stripped-leaves (orig-fn toc-entries)
  "Remove label"
  :around #'org-html--toc-text
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn toc-entries)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "<input [^>]+><label [^>]+>\\(.+?\\)</label></li>" "\\1</li>"
                              (funcall orig-fn toc-entries))))
#+end_src
**** Make verbatim different to code
Since we have =verbatim= and ~code~, let's make use of the difference.

We can use ~code~ exclusively for code snippets and commands like: "calling
src_elisp{(message "Hello")} in batch-mode Emacs prints to stdout like ~echo~".
Then we can use =verbatim= for miscellaneous 'other monospace' like keyboard
shortcuts: "either =C-c C-c= or =C-g= is likely the most useful keybinding in Emacs",
or file names: "I keep my configuration in =~/.config/doom/=", among other things.

Then, styling these two cases differently can help improve clarity in a document.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "<b>%s</b>")
        (code . "<code>%s</code>")
        (italic . "<i>%s</i>")
        (strike-through . "<del>%s</del>")
        (underline . "<span class=\"underline\">%s</span>")
        (verbatim . "<kbd>%s</kbd>")))
#+end_src
**** Change checkbox type
We also want to use HTML checkboxes, however we want to get a bit fancier than default
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(appendq! org-html-checkbox-types
          '((html-span
             (on . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (off . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (trans . "<span class='checkbox'></span>"))))
(setq org-html-checkbox-type 'html-span)
#+end_src

**** Extra special strings
The ~org-html-special-string-regexps~ variable defines substitutions for:
+ =\-=, a shy hyphen
+ =---=, an em dash
+ =--=, an en dash
+ =...=, (horizontal) ellipses

However I think it would be nice if there was also a substitution for left/right
arrows (=->= and =<-=). This is a ~defconst~, but as you may tell from the amount of
advice in this config, I'm not above messing with things I'm not 'supposed' to.

The only minor complication is that =<= and =>= are converted to =&lt;= and =&gt;=
before this stage of output processing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(pushnew! org-html-special-string-regexps
          '("-&gt;" . "&#8594;")
          '("&lt;-" . "&#8592;"))

**** Header anchors
I want to add GitHub-style links on hover for headings.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-export-html-headline-anchor (text backend info)
  (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
             (not (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 're-reveal))

      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "<h\\([0-9]\\) id=\"\\([a-z0-9-]+\\)\">\\(.*[^ ]\\)<\\/h[0-9]>" ; this is quite restrictive, but due to `org-reference-contraction' I can do this
       "<h\\1 id=\"\\2\">\\3<a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#\\2\">#</a> </h\\1>"
       text))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-headline-functions
             'org-export-html-headline-anchor)
#+end_src
**** Link previews
Sometimes it's nice to make a link particularly prominent, an embed/preview like
Twitter does would be nice I think.

We can do this without too much trouble by adding a new link type ever so
slightly different from =https= --- =Https=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "Https"
                         :follow (lambda (url arg) (browse-url (concat "https:" url) arg))
                         :export #'org-url-fancy-export)
#+end_src

Then, if we can fetch a plist of the form src_elisp{(:title "..." :description
"..." :image "...")} for such links via a function ~org-url-unfurl-metadata~, we
can make a fancy export.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-url-fancy-export (url _desc backend)
  (let ((metadata (org-url-unfurl-metadata (concat "https:" url))))
    (cond
     ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
      (concat
       "<div class=\"link-preview\">"
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">" (concat "https:" url))
       (when (plist-get metadata :image)
         (format "<img src=\"%s\"/>" (plist-get metadata :image)))
       "<small>"
       (replace-regexp-in-string "//\\(?:www\\.\\)?\\([^/]+\\)/?.*" "\\1" url)
       "</small><p>"
       (when (plist-get metadata :title)
         (concat "<b>" (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :title)) "</b></br>"))
       (when (plist-get metadata :description)
         (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :description)))
       "</p></a></div>"))
     (t url))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to actually implement that metadata extraction function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache nil)
(defun org-url-unfurl-metadata (url)
  (cdr (or (assoc url org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache)
           (car (push
                 (cons

                                    (with-current-buffer (progn (message "Fetching metadata from %s" url)
                                                                (url-retrieve-synchronously url t t 5))
                                      (goto-char (point-min))
                                      (delete-region (point-min) (- (search-forward "<head") 6))
                                      (delete-region (search-forward "</head>") (point-max))

                                        (replace-match ""))

**** LaTeX Rendering
***** Pre-rendered
I consider ~dvisvgm~ to be a rather compelling option. However this isn't scaled
very well at the moment.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default org-html-with-latex `dvisvgm)
#+end_src

***** MathJax
If MathJax is used, we want to use version 3 instead of the default version 2.
Looking at a [[https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php][comparison]] we seem to find that it is ~5 times as fast, uses a
single file instead of multiple, but seems to be a bit bigger unfortunately.
Thankfully this can be mitigated my adding the ~async~ attribute to defer loading.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-mathjax-options
      '((path "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-svg.js" )
        (scale "1")
        (autonumber "ams")
        (multlinewidth "85%")
        (tagindent ".8em")
        (tagside "right")))

(setq org-html-mathjax-template
      "<script>
MathJax = {
  chtml: {
    scale: %SCALE
  },
  svg: {
    scale: %SCALE,
    fontCache: \"global\"
  },
  tex: {
    tags: \"%AUTONUMBER\",
    multlineWidth: \"%MULTLINEWIDTH\",
    tagSide: \"%TAGSIDE\",
    tagIndent: \"%TAGINDENT\"
  }
};
</script>
<script id=\"MathJax-script\" async
        src=\"%PATH\"></script>")
#+end_src
*** LaTeX Export
**** Compiling
By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process
	  '("xelatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	    ;; "biber %b" "xelatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	    "bibtex %b"
	    "xelatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	    "xelatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
;;(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** Nicer checkboxes

We'll assume that thanks to the clever preamble the various custom =\checkbox...=
commands below are defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes (text backend info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (replace-regexp-in-string
     "\\\\item\\[{$\\\\\\(\\w+\\)$}\\]"
     (lambda (fullmatch)
       (concat "\\\\item[" (pcase (substring fullmatch 9 -3) ; content of capture group
                             ("square"   "\\\\checkboxUnchecked")
                             ("boxminus" "\\\\checkboxTransitive")
                             ("boxtimes" "\\\\checkboxChecked")
                             (_ (substring fullmatch 9 -3))) "]"))
     text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-item-functions
             '+org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes)
#+end_src

**** Normal spaces after abbreviations

In LaTeX inter-word and sentence spaces are typically of different widths. This
can be an issue when using abbreviations i.e. e.g. etc. et al..
This can be corrected by forcing a normal space with src_LaTeX{\ }.
When exporting Org documents, we can add a filter to check for common
abbreviations and make the space normal.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +org-latex-abbreviations
  '(;; Latin
    "cf." "e.g." "etc." "et al." "i.e." "v." "vs." "viz." "n.b."
    ;; Corperate
    "inc." "govt." "ltd." "pty." "dept."
    ;; Temporal
    "est." "c."
    ;; Honorifics
    "Prof." "Dr." "Mr." "Mrs." "Ms." "Miss." "Sr." "Jr."
    ;; Components of a work
    "ed." "vol." "sec." "chap." "pt." "pp." "op." "no."
    ;; Common usage
    "approx." "misc." "min." "max.")
  "A list of abbreviations that should be spaced correctly when exporting to LaTeX.")

(defun +org-latex-correct-latin-abbreviation-spaces (text backend _info)
  "Normalise spaces after Latin abbreviations."
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (replace-regexp-in-string (rx (group (or line-start space)
                                         (regexp (regexp-opt-group +org-latex-abbreviations)))
                                  (or line-end space))
                              "\\1\\\\ "
                              text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-paragraph-functions #'+org-latex-correct-latin-abbreviation-spaces t)
#+end_src

**** Extra special strings
LaTeX already recognises =---= and =--= as em/en-dashes, =\-= as a shy hyphen, and the
conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike
~org-html-plain-text~).

I'd quite like to also recognise =->= and =<-=, so let's set come up with some advice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-extra-special-string-regexps
  '(("->" . "\\\\textrightarrow{}")
    ("<-" . "\\\\textleftarrow{}")))

(defun org-latex-convert-extra-special-strings (string)
  "Convert special characters in STRING to LaTeX."
  (dolist (a org-latex-extra-special-string-regexps string)
    (let ((re (car a))
          (rpl (cdr a)))
      (setq string (replace-regexp-in-string re rpl string t)))))

(defadvice! org-latex-plain-text-extra-special-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Make `org-latex-plain-text' handle some extra special strings."
  :around #'org-latex-plain-text
  (let ((output (funcall orig-fn text info)))
    (when (plist-get info :with-special-strings)
      (setq output (org-latex-convert-extra-special-strings output)))
    output))
#+end_src

**** Support images from URLs
You can link to remote images easily, and they work nicely with HTML-based
exports. However, LaTeX can only include local files, and so the current
behaviour of =org-latex-link= is just to insert a URL to the image.

We can do better than that by downloading the image to a predictable location,
and using that. By making the filename predictable as opposed to just another
tempfile, this can provide a caching mechanism.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +org-latex-link (orig-fn link desc info)
  "Acts as `org-latex-link', but supports remote images."
  :around #'org-latex-link
  (setq o-link link
        o-desc desc
        o-info info)
  (if (and (member (plist-get (cadr link) :type) '("http" "https"))
           (member (file-name-extension (plist-get (cadr link) :path))
                   '("png" "jpg" "jpeg" "pdf" "svg")))
      (org-latex-link--remote link desc info)
    (funcall orig-fn link desc info)))

(defun org-latex-link--remote (link _desc info)
  (let* ((url (plist-get (cadr link) :raw-link))
         (ext (file-name-extension url))
         (target (format "%s%s.%s"
                         (temporary-file-directory)
                         (replace-regexp-in-string "[./]" "-"
                                                   (file-name-sans-extension (substring (plist-get (cadr link) :path) 2)))
                         ext)))
    (unless (file-exists-p target)
      (url-copy-file url target))
    (setcdr link (--> (cadr link)
                   (plist-put it :type "file")
                   (plist-put it :path target)
                   (plist-put it :raw-link (concat "file:" target))
                   (list it)))
    (concat "% fetched from " url "\n"
            (org-latex--inline-image link info))))
#+end_src
**** Chameleon --- aka. match theme

Once I had the idea of having the look of the LaTeX document produced match the
current Emacs theme, I was enraptured. The result is the pseudo-class ~chameleon~,
which I have implemented in the package =ox-chameleon=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! ox-chameleon :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/ox-chameleon"))
#+end_src

**** Make verbatim different to code
Since have just gone to so much effort above let's make the most of it by making
=verbatim= use ~verb~ instead of ~protectedtexttt~ (default).

This gives the same advantages as mentioned in the [[*Make verbatim different to code][HTML export section]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "\\textbf{%s}")
        (code . protectedtexttt)
        (italic . "\\emph{%s}")
        (strike-through . "\\sout{%s}")
        (underline . "\\uline{%s}")

*** Beamer Export
It's nice to use a different theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-theme "[progressbar=foot]metropolis")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-beamer-p (info)
  (eq 'beamer (and (plist-get info :back-end) (org-export-backend-name (plist-get info :back-end)))))
#+end_src

And I think that it's natural to divide a presentation into sections, e.g.
Introduction, Overview... so let's set bump up the headline level that becomes a
frame from ~1~ to ~2~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-frame-level 2)
#+end_src
*** Reveal export

By default reveal is rather nice, there are just a few tweaks that I consider a
good idea.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-re-reveal-theme "white"
      org-re-reveal-transition "slide"
      org-re-reveal-plugins '(markdown notes math search zoom))
#+end_src
*** ASCII export

To start with, why settle for ASCII when UTF-8 exists?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ascii-charset 'utf-8)
#+end_src

The ASCII export is generally fairly nice. I think the main aspect that could
benefit from improvement is the appearance of LaTeX fragments. There's a nice
utility we can use to create unicode representation, which are much nicer.
It's called ~latex2text~, and it's part of the =pylatexenc= package, and it's [[https://repology.org/project/python:pylatexenc/versions][not
really packaged]]. So, we'll resort to installing it with =pip=.

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pylatexenc
#+end_src

With that installed, we can override the src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-fragment)} and
src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-environment)} functions, which are conveniently very
slim --- just extracting the content, and indenting. We'll only do something
different when =utf-8= is set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "yes" "no")
(after! ox-ascii
  (defvar org-ascii-convert-latex t

*** Markdown Export
**** GFM

Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! ox-gfm :pin "99f93011b069e02b37c9660b8fcb45dab086a07f")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! ox-gfm
  :after ox)
#+end_src

**** Character substitutions

When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere (for example when using [[Emacs Everywhere][Emacs
Everywhere]]), it can be preferable to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead
of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…")
           ("->" . "→")
           ("<-" . "←"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to Markdown."

      (cond
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\(" frag)
        (concat "$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$"))
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\\\[" frag)
        (concat "$$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$$"))
       (t (message "unrecognised fragment: %s" frag)
          frag))))

  ;; We can't let this be immediately parsed and evaluated,
  ;; because eager macro-expansion tries to call as-of-yet

*** Babel
Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** LAAS

This makes use of =aas= (/Auto Activating Snippets/) for CDLaTeX-like symbol input.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! laas :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/LaTeX-auto-activating-snippets"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! laas
  :hook (LaTeX-mode . laas-mode)
  :config
  (defun laas-tex-fold-maybe ()
    (unless (equal "/" aas-transient-snippet-key)
      (+latex-fold-last-macro-a)))
  (add-hook 'aas-post-snippet-expand-hook #'laas-tex-fold-maybe))
#+end_src

*** SyncTeX
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tex
  (add-to-list 'TeX-view-program-list '("Evince" "evince %o"))
  (add-to-list 'TeX-view-program-selection '(output-pdf "Evince")))
#+end_src
*** Fixes
In case of Emacs28,

** Python
Since I'm using =mypyls=, as suggested in [[file:~/.emacs.d/modules/lang/python/README.org::*Language Server Protocol Support][:lang python LSP support]] I'll tweak the
priority of =mypyls=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! lsp-python-ms
  (set-lsp-priority! 'mspyls 1))
#+end_src
** PDF
*** MuPDF

=pdf-tools= is nice, but a =mupdf=-based solution is nicer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(package! paper :recipe (:host github :repo "ymarco/paper-mode"
                         :files ("*.el" ".so")
                         :pre-build ("make")))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; (use-package paper
;;   ;; :mode ("\\.pdf\\'"  . paper-mode)
;;   ;; :mode ("\\.epub\\'"  . paper-mode)
;;   :config
;;   (require 'evil-collection-paper)
;;   (evil-collection-paper-setup))
#+end_src

*** Terminal viewing

Sometimes I'm in a terminal and I still want to see the content. Additionally,
sometimes I'd like to act on the textual content and so would like a plaintext version.
Thanks to src_shell{pdftotext} we have a convenient way of performing this conversion.
I've integrated this into a little package, =pdftotext.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! pdftotext :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/pdftotext"))
#+end_src

The output can be slightly nicer without spelling errors, and with prettier page
feeds (=^L= by default).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
#+end_src

This is very nice, now we just need to associate it with =.pdf= files, and make
sure =pdf-tools= doesn't take priority.

Lastly, whenever Emacs is non-graphical (i.e. a TUI), we want to use this by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "pdftotext") "yes" "no")
(use-package! pdftotext
  :init
  (unless (display-graphic-p)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[pP][dD][fF]\\'" . pdftotext-mode))
    (add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '("%PDF" . pdftotext-mode)))
  :config
  (unless (display-graphic-p) (after! pdf-tools (pdftotext-install)))
  ;; For prettyness
  (add-hook 'pdftotext-mode-hook #'spell-fu-mode-disable)
  (add-hook 'pdftotext-mode-hook (lambda () (page-break-lines-mode 1)))
  ;; I have no idea why this is needed
  (map! :map pdftotext-mode-map
        "<mouse-4>" (cmd! (scroll-down mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal))
        "<mouse-5>" (cmd! (scroll-up mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal))))

** Markdown

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(markdown-header-face-1 :height 1.25 :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-2 :height 1.15 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-3 :height 1.08 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-4 :height 1.00 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-5 :height 0.90 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-6 :height 0.75 :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face))
